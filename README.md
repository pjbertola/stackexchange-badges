# stackexchange-badges
See badges of an user
Utilizing Stack Exchange public api build an application that allows users to login to his stack overflow account, and see its badges. The app should consist of 3 screens.

    Onboarding screen for users not registered, where I can start the authentication process.

    Main Screen displaying the username, profile image, total badge count  and reputation.

    Tapping on the badge count section should show a second screen where I should be able to see all my badges. The user should have the option to sort badges according to their colour ( gold, silver, bronze)
